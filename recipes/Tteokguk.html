        <li>1 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2/3 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1/3 dry seaweed</li>
        <li>1 2/3 cups thinly sliced Korean rice cake(garae tteok)</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups Korean beef bone stock</li>
        <li>2/3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </uL>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Beat egg yolks in a small bowl and pour into the skillet. Tilt skillet so eggs yolks spread in a thin and even sheet. Cook until set, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to
            a cutting board and slice into thin strips. Repeat with egg whites.</li>
        <li>Place dry seaweed in another skillet over medium heat; toast until bright green and crispy, about 30 seconds per side. Cut into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Rinse rice cakes in cold water; drain.</li>
        <li>Pour beef stock into a large pot; bring to a boil. Add rice cakes and garlic. Simmer until rice cake slices are tender, about 5 minutes. Add green onions; continue cooking until rice cakes start floating to the top, 3 to 5 minutes more. Season
            with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into serving bowls. Garnish with egg and nori strips.</li>
    </ol>
