# odin-recipes
Hello!
This is my first Odin Project assignment, THE ODIN RECIPES! Ta da!
JK, it's going to be a basic web page.

With this project, I will be testing my basic HTML skill. After finishing this project, I will be able to confidently say I know HTML.

Good luck to myself. :)

Just finished Odin Recipes project.
I added two recipes, chicken salad and tteokguk, Korea rice cake soup.
I was able to implement a simple recipe web page with basic html elements(anchor, unordered list, ordered list, img, and etc).
